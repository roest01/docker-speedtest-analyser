# Docker Speedtest Analyser

Automated docker speedtest analyser tool with included web interface to monitor your internet speed connection over time. Setup at home on your NAS (Synology, QNAP tested) and the container runs hourly speedtests. The speedtest results are displayed in an web interface as line graph(s) over the day.

This tool was created in reference to [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/43fi39/i_set_up_my_raspberry_pi_to_automatically_tweet/).  
It used [speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) to make speedtests and log them into a CSV file.  
After that you can visit the web interface to view a hourly - time filterable reports about
your internet connectivity speed.
